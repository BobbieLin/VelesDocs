# Prerequisites

Veles is a Python library, so before using it, you need to install Python. You can download an installation bundle from [the official website](https://www.python.org/). During installation, check the box saying to add Python to PATH. It will enable you to run Python by writing `python` in the terminal, without the full path. If you're using Linux or MacOS, you already have Python installed by default.

Using an IDE is recommended. You can use any IDE, but I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you want to use it, it's a good idea to also download [Python Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python-extension-pack) and [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance). You can do it from within the program. You can also use RStudio if you want.

Some really basic knowledge how to use Python is recommended. If you know what's a variable and how to call functions, you're good to go. If you don't know anything about programming, [this 1-hour introduction](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8) will be more than enough (although I think VSCode is better than PyCharm).

To actually build (or even preview) your survey, you **must have `yarn` installed**. It's a JavaScript package manager and is used to download some dependencies like Survey.js and React. `yarn` gets installed with Node.js. If you're a Windows user, you can download it from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). MacOS comes with Node.js preinstalled. If you're a Linux user, chances are you have `npm` already installed. Otherwise you can use one of the following commands:

``` bash
# Ubuntu (and other apt distros)
sudo apt install npm

# Arch
sudo pacman -S npm

# winget
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# Chocolatey
choco install nodejs-lts

# Homebrew
brew install node
```

If everything is OK you should be able to run this command in your terminal (PowerShell or cmd in Windows):

``` bash
npm -v
```

fter installing `node.js`, activate `yarn` with this command in the terminal:

``` bash
corepack enable
```

If everything went well, command `yarn -v` should return a version number.

# Installation

To install Veles, open your terminal (PowerShell or cmd on Windows), write the following command and hit enter.

``` bash
pip install velesresearch
```

You can also choose development version (unstable) using this command:

``` bash
pip install velesresearch@git+https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/VelesResearch.git
```

# Create project

Veles project is just a folder with a Python script. Output will be created in the same folder. Create a folder and open it in Visual Studio Code. From inside VS Code you can create a file with `.py` extension. It it, we'll be writing the survey structure.

The first thing we need to do is to import the `velesresearch` library. To do this, at the top of your script write:

```{python}
import velesresearch as vls

```

# Survey structure

In SurveyJS, which is the base of Veles, surveys consist of pages, panels and questions. We can create them separately and then combine them into a complete survey.

![Survey structure. Source: SurveyJS documentation](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/images/survey-structure.svg)

Veles is a Python library, so there are many ways to achieve this in practice. We can put things in separate variables and then combine them or nest appropriate functions. In here I'll mainly be using the first approach.

## Questions

In Veles, questions are a class of objects. There are two main ways of creating them -- separately or when we want to convert a whole questionnaire at once. In both cases we use the `question()` function.

### `question()`

Let's start with creating some metrical questions with `question()`. The syntax is as follows:

```{python}
vls.question(label, question_text, answers, question_type, options, description)
```

The first four arguments are required. `label` is an internal name of the question. It will become a column name in the database. Question type is a string representing one of the available question types. `question_text` is what the participant actually sees as an item in the survey. `answers` are the options the participant can choose. It can be a list or strings separated by commas. `question_type` defaults to `"radio"`. `options` can change the survey's behaviour (e.g. make the answer order random), but I'll provide more details later. `description` look like a subtitle. Both `options` and `description` arguments must be named if used (i.e. you need to write `options=`).

```{python}
gender = vls.question(
    "gender",
    "What is your gender?",
    "Woman",
    "Man",
    "Other/I don't want to answer",
    description="Choose an answer from options below.",
)
```

![Gender question example](figs/getting_started/gender_question_example.png)

Every question type has its own wrapper functions, so we could also write `gender = vls.radio("gender", "What is your gender?", ...)`. A complete list of available question types can be found [here](ref/questiontypes.qmd).

### Question options

Each question can have a series of options specified. To make it easier, there's `QuestionOptions` object class which has all available options listed. Let's use it to change answer order to random and add real None and Other options. We can create `QuestionOptions` outside the question itself, save it in a variable and put the variable in the `question()` function. We can also nest the `QuestionOptions` object inside the `question()` function.

```{python}
gender = vls.question(
    "gender",
    "What is your gender?",
    "Woman",
    "Man",
    options=QuestionOptions(
        answers_order="random",
        none=True,
        none_text="I don't want to answer",
        other=True,
        other_placeholder="Write your gender.",
    ),
    description="Choose an answer from options below.",
)
```

![Gender questions with options specified](figs/getting_started/gender_question_options_example.png)

List of available options can be found [here](ref/options/QuestionOptions.qmd).

### Whole questionnaires

Often in behavioral sciences we want to use a whole questionnaire. It's quite pointless to format every item separately, because they often have the same scale, options and predictable labels. In Veles the `question()` also allows to convert a whole questionnaire at once.

To do this, we need to have the questionnaire in the form of a Python list. We can format it either by hand, using `split()` method or with `split` arguments. In the second and third cases, we need to have our items separated by some common separator, e.g. every item in a separate line. Both methods are shown below

```{python}
# manually formatted list
RSSI_items = [
    "I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.",
    "I feel that I have a number of good qualities.",
    "All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.",
    "I am able to do things as well as most other people.",
    "I feel I do not have much to be proud of.",
    "I take a positive attitude toward myself.",
    "On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.",
    "I wish I could have more respect for myself.",
    "I certainly feel useless at times.",
    "At times I think I am no good at all.",
]

# triple quotation for multi-line strings
RSSI_items = """I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.
I feel that I have a number of good qualities.
All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.
I am able to do things as well as most other people.
I feel I do not have much to be proud of.
I take a positive attitude toward myself.
On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.
I wish I could have more respect for myself.
I certainly feel useless at times.
At times I think I am no good at all."""

# scale
RSSI_scale = "Strongly Agree; Agree; Disagree; Strongly Disagree"

RSSI = vls.question(
    "RSSI",
    RSSI.split("\n"),
    RSSI_scale.split("; "),
    options=QuestionOptions(required=True),
)
```

The `"""` allows us to write multiple line strings.

We save our items and answers in variables and treat them with `split()`. In here I've done it inside the `question()` function, but I also could have done it anywhere before that. To learn more about Python string methods, see [W3Schools lesson](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) about them. Had I used the manually formatted list, I wouldn't have to write the `split()` part.

If `question_text` is a list, `question()` output is a list of questions. Each question in the list have the same options, scale and type. The labels will become `"RSSI_1"`, `"RSSI_2"`, `"RSSI_3"` etc.

### List comprehension

The power of Python allows us to bulk modify our questions and answers. This might be the greatest advantage Veles has over its GUI-based[^1] alternatives. Let's imagine we have a list of drinks we want to ask about in our survey. Yet we don't want the question text to be just "Tea" or "Coffee" (especially coffee) but rather something like "How do you feel about tea?". English being fairly uncomplicated, we just need to put the drink's name into the sentence. We can easily use a loop and an f-string to do just that.

[^1]: Or WYSIWYG.

```{python}
from velesresearch import question

# get our drinks and make them a list
drinks = "tea coffee juice water".split(" ")

# modify with a loop
drinks = [f"How do you like {drink}?" for drink in drinks]

# add some answers
answers = "I love it; I like it; It's OK; I don't like it; I despise it".split("; ")

# make it a list of questions
q_drinks = question("drinks", drinks, answers)
```

First we get our drinks separated with some common separator (a space in this example). We then split it and save it in a `drinks` variable. After that we modify it with an f-string and a for loop. An f-string is a string preceded with an `f`. Inside it, we can use variables' values if we enclose them in curly braces. After the f-string we put a shorthand loop syntax (it's called *list comprehension*). It will take every value inside the `drinks` one by one, put them in a variable called `drink`[^2] and do whatever we commanded before the `for` keyword. When it's done with the first value, it saves the result and moves on to the next drink until the list ends. Notice everything is in **square brackets**. We then overwrite the `drinks` variable with the newly created list.

[^2]: We could have called it otherwise. `[f"How do you like {i}?" for i in drinks]` would give the same result, but it makes more sense to call it `drink` rather than `i`, doesn't it?

### Questionnaire library

Veles has it's own (currently small) questionnaire library. Thanks to it, you can quickly add a whole questionnaire with only one command. The library is available in the `veleslibrary` package. To use it, you need to install and import it first.

```{bash}
# In the terminal
pip install veleslibrary
```

```{python}
from veleslibrary.questionnaires import rse

survey("self_esteem_survey", page("RSE", rse()))  # Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale
```

Library is multilingual.

```{python}
from veleslibrary.questionnaires.pl import tipi

survey("personality", page("TIPI", tipi()))  # TIPI in Polish
```

Go [here](/library/overview.qmd) to read more about the library. Feel free to contribute to the library by adding your own questionnaires. More information [here](/library/overview.qmd#contributing).

## Panels

To be implemented...

## Pages

Every survey needs to have at least one page. Page is basically a list of questions but with its own label, title, description and options. You can create it with `page()`.

```{python}
vls.page(label, questions, title, description, options)
```

Pages have their own labels. They don't yet have many uses in Veles but are still mandatory for SurveyJS compatibility reasons. Questions can be provided as a list or values separated by commas. You can also provide page's title and description. The `options` argument accepts a `PageOptions` object. These are **different options** than in `QuestionOptions`. The list of available options can be found [here](ref/options/PageOptions.qmd).

```{python}
intro = vls.page("metrics", gender)

limit = vls.PageOptions(time_limit=120)

self_esteem = vls.page("RSSI", RSSI, options=limit)
```

## Survey

When all elements are created, we can combine them into the final survey. We can do this with `survey()` function. It does two things -- returns a `Survey` object and builds a website with your survey.

```{python}
vls.survey(label, pages, title, description, options, create)
```

```{python}
vls.survey("My smart research", intro, self_esteem, title="Self-esteem and gender")
```

Building a website for the first time might take a few minutes due to `yarn` downloading or updating JavaScript dependencies. When the dependencies have been downloaded, the whole process gets much faster. The structure of the generated files and what to do with them is explained in Hosting section [below](#sec-hosting).

# PsychoJS experiments

To be implemented...

# How to run your script

After writing your survey, you need to build it. Don't worry, it all happens automatically. Just run your script with Python and wait for the website to be built. It might take a few minutes the first time, but after that it will be much faster. How do we run a python script? There are many ways to do this. If you use Visual Studio Code, there's a "Run" button in the upper right corner. Just click it and see if the console prints any errors.

If everything went well, you should have a folder named like your survey's label. Inside there will be a series of files and folders. The most important one is the `.tar.gz` file. It's an archive with all the files needed to host your survey. You can upload it to [VelesWeb](https://www.velesweb.org/). If you want to host the survey yourself, the most important part of the package will be the `build` folder where you can find the built webpage. The structure of the files is explained more broadly in Hosting section [below](#sec-hosting).

# Hosting {#sec-hosting}

The main way to host Veles surveys is through [VelesWeb](https://www.velesweb.org/). Currently in closed alpha. Veles isn't meant to be a commercial product so even if VelesWeb will get some restrictions and paywalls (it mostly depends on the maintenance costs), there will always be an alternative. You can host your surveys yourself.

## VelesWeb

When you generate a Survey, you get a folder with a series of files. Their structure is not that important if you intent to use [VelesWeb](https://www.velesweb.org/). The only file that will be interesting, is the archive with `.tar.gz` extension.

Log in to your VelesWeb account, create a new survey, give it a title and -- optionally -- a description. Then choose the `.tar.gz` file from your hard drive. Submit and wait. It might take a minute or two. After that you'll see your survey's overview.

::: light-mode
![](figs/getting_started/velesweb_overview.png)
:::
::: dark-mode
![](figs/getting_started/velesweb_overview_dark.png)
:::

From here you can test the survey, make it offline or turn on the real data collection. Each survey has two databases -- the main one and the test one. The test mode is the default. As you can see below, responses collected in both modes are separated. This makes it easier to test your survey without worrying about messing up the data.

## Self-hosting

If we want to manage our surveys ourselves, we need a place to host them and a place to store the results. Luckily there are free methods to do both. In here we'll use Vercel for hosting and MongoDB Atlas for storing the results. Additional benefit of self-hosting is that we can use our own domain name e.g. create a special subdomain in our university's domain (like `surveys.uwr.edu.pl`). That is if someone will give us access to the DNS settings.

### Configuration

1. Go to [VelesSurvey for Vercel GitHub repository](https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/VelesSurvey-Vercel). Click on "Use this template" button. Give your repo a name and confirm with "Create repository from template" button. Of course you need to be logged into your GitHub account.

2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), create an account and from there start a new project. Link the project to your newly created GitHub repo.

3. Don't change the default deployment settings but do click on `Enviroment variables`. Add a new variable named `SECRET_KEY` with a value generated with [this website](https://djecrety.ir/) and confirm with "Add" button. If you plan to use a custom domain, you can also add a `DOMAIN_NAME` variable with a value like `.uwr.edu.pl` to match all subdomains of `uwr.edu.pl`. Don't worry, if you don't know yet. You can always add it later. You can read more about custom domains [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains/add-a-domain).

4. When the building process ends, you can visit your page. It's just a white screen with a moving Veles logo. By design, there's no survey list on the main page. It helps keeping everything confidential.

5. Not only we need a place to collect our responses, but also somewhere to store them. For this purpuse we'll use MongoDB and its free 512 MB of space. My rough calculations say it will allow us to collect around 1 600 000 responses before the space runs out. I wish everyone this kind of probe sizes. Go to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), create a free account and then a free cluster. The website will take you through the whole process.

6. Now we need do connect Vercel and MongoDB. You can do it on [this website](https://vercel.com/integrations/mongodbatlas). Click "Add integration" and go with the forms. It will make some needed security changes to your MongoDB cluster, so the answers can be sent from Vercel app to the database.

7. That's it. Test your application by going to `/tea_survey` in your Vercel app (e.g. `https://tea-research-project.vercel.app/tea_survey/`). You should see a survey with a series of questions about tea. When you complete it, you should see a new response in your database.

### Using

When you create a survey with Veles, you get a folder with a series of files. The most important one is `main.js` from `build` subfolder. To add it to your site, you need to create a new subfolder in the `surveys` folder in your repository. The easiest way to do it it through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Use it to download (or "clone") your repository and create a new folder inside the `surveys` folder. The name of that folder will become a link to your survey, e.g. if you name it `black_tea_study`, the link will be something like `https://tea-research-project.vercel.app/black_tea_study`. Then put your `main.js` in your newly created folder. **Do not rename it.** Then use GitHub Desktop to upload (or "push") your changes. After a minute or so, your survey should be available.

To read and save your data you can use web desktop on [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/) or with a special program called [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass). After any responses are recieved (even for the tea survey), a new database called `VelesResponses` is created. Every survey gets its own folder (or "collection"). From there you can easily export your data to `.csv` or `.json`.
