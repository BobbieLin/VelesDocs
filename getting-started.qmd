# Prerequisites

Veles is a python library, so before using it, you need to install python. You can download an installation bundle from [the official website](https://www.python.org/). During installation, check the box saying to add python to PATH. It will enable you to run python by writing `python` in the terminal, without the full path.

Using an IDE is recommended. You can use any IDE, but I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# Installation

To install Veles, open your terminal (PowerShell or cmd on Windows), write the following command and hit enter.

``` {python}
pip install VelesResearch
```
