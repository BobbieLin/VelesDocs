# Prerequisites

Veles is a Python library, so before using it, you need to install Python. You can download an installation bundle from [the official website](https://www.python.org/). During installation, check the box saying to add Python to PATH. It will enable you to run Python by writing `python` in the terminal, without the full path.

Using an IDE is recommended. You can use any IDE, but I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Some really basic knowledge how to use Python is recommended. If you know what's a variable and how to call functions, you're good to go.

To actually build (or even preview) your survey, you **must have `yarn` installed**. It's a JavaScript package manager and is used to download some dependencies like Survey.js and React. `yarn` gets installed with Node.js. If you're a Windows or Mac user, you can download it from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). If you're a Linux user, chances are you have `npm` already installed. Otherwise you can use one of the following commands:

``` bash
# Ubuntu (and other apt distros)
sudo apt install npm

# Arch
sudo pacman -S npm

# winget
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# Chocolatey
choco install nodejs-lts

# Homebrew
brew install node
```

If everything is OK, you should be able to run this command in your terminal:

``` bash
npm -v
```

fter installing `node.js`, activate `yarn` with this command in the terminal:

``` bash
corepack enable
```

If everything went well, command `yarn -v` should return a version number.

# Installation

To install Veles, open your terminal (PowerShell or cmd on Windows), write the following command and hit enter.

``` bash
pip install velesresearch
```

You can also choose development version using this command:

```         
pip install velesresearch@git+https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/VelesResearch.git
```

# Create project

Veles project is just a folder with a Python script. Output will be created in the same folder. Create a folder and open it in Visual Studio Code. From inside VS Code you can create a file with `.py` extension. It it, we'll be writing the survey structure.

The first thing we need to do is to import the `velesresearch` library. To do this, at the top of your script write:

```{python}
import velesresearch as vls

```

# Survey structure

In SurveyJS, which is the base of Veles, surveys consist of pages, panels and questions. We can create them separately and then combine them into a complete survey.

![Survey structure. Source: SurveyJS documentation.](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/images/survey-structure.svg)

Veles is a Python library, so there are many ways to achieve this in practice. We can put things in separate variables and then combine them or nest appropriate functions. In here I'll mainly be using the first approach.

## Questions

In Veles, questions are a class of objects. There are two main ways of creating them -- separately or when we want to convert a whole questionnaire at once. In both cases we use the `question()` function.

### `question()`

Let's start with creating some metrical questions with `question()`. The syntax is as follows:

```{python}
vls.question(label, question_text, answers, question_type, options, description)
```

The first four arguments are required. `label` is an internal name of the question. It will become a column name in the database. Question type is a string representing one of the available question types. `question_text` is what the participant actually sees as an item in the survey. `answers` are the options the participant can choose. It can be a list or strings separated by commas. `question_type` defaults to `"radio"`. `options` can change the survey's behaviour (e.g. make the answer order random), but we'll provide more details later. `description` look like a subtitle. Both `options` and `description` arguments must be named if used.

```{python}
gender = vls.question(
    "gender",
    "What is your gender?",
    "Woman",
    "Man",
    "Other/I don't want to answer",
    description="Choose an answer from options below.",
)
```

![Gender question example](figs/getting_started/gender_question_example.png)

Every question type has its own wrapper functions, so we could also write `gender = vls.radio("gender", What is your gender?", ...)`. A complete list of available question types can be found [here](ref/tools/question_types.qmd).

### Question options

Each question can have a series of options specified. To make it easier, there's `QuestionOptions` object class which has all available options listed. Let's use it to change answer order to random and add real None and Other options. We can create `QuestionOptions` outside the question itself, save it in a variable and put the variable in the `question()` function. We can also nest the `QuestionOptions` object inside the `question()` function.

```{python}
gender = vls.question(
    "gender",
    "What is your gender?",
    "Woman",
    "Man",
    options=QuestionOptions(
        answers_order="random",
        none=True,
        none_text="I don't want to answer",
        other=True,
        other_placeholder="Write your gender.",
    ),
    description="Choose an answer from options below.",
)
```

![Gender questions with options specified](figs/getting_started/gender_question_options_example.png)

List of available options can be found [here](ref/options/QuestionOptions.qmd).

### Whole questionnaires

Often in psychological sciences we want to use a whole questionnaire. It's quite pointless to format every item separately, because they often have the same scale, options and predictable labels. In Veles the `question()` also allows to convert a whole questionnaire at once.

To do this, we need to have the questionnaire in the form of a Python list. We can format it either by hand, using `split()` method or with `split` arguments. In the second and third cases, we need to have our items separated by some specified separator, e.g. every item in a separate line.

```{python}
# manually formatted list
RSSI_items = [
    "I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.",
    "I feel that I have a number of good qualities.",
    "All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.",
    "I am able to do things as well as most other people.",
    "I feel I do not have much to be proud of.",
    "I take a positive attitude toward myself.",
    "On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.",
    "I wish I could have more respect for myself.",
    "I certainly feel useless at times.",
    "At times I think I am no good at all.",
]

# triple quotation for multi-line strings
RSSI_items = """I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.
I feel that I have a number of good qualities.
All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.
I am able to do things as well as most other people.
I feel I do not have much to be proud of.
I take a positive attitude toward myself.
On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.
I wish I could have more respect for myself.
I certainly feel useless at times.
At times I think I am no good at all."""

# scale
RSSI_scale = "Strongly Agree; Agree; Disagree; Strongly Disagree"

RSSI = vls.question(
    "RSSI",
    RSSI.split("\n"),
    RSSI_scale.split("; "),
    options=QuestionOptions(required=True),
)
```

The `"""` allows us to write multiple line strings.

We save our items and answers in variables and treat them with `split()`. In here I've done it inside the `question()` function, but I also could have done it anywhere before that. To learn more about Python string methods, see [W3Schools lesson](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) about them.

If `question_text` is a list, `question()` output is a question list. Each question have the same options, scale and type. The labels are `"RSSI_1"`, `"RSSI_2"`, `"RSSI_3"` etc.

## Panels

To be implemented...

## Pages

Every survey needs to have at least one page. You can create it with `page()`.

```{python}
vls.page(label, questions, title, description, options)
```

Pages have their own labels. Questions can be provided as a list or separated by commas. You can also provide page's title and description. The `options` argument accepts a `PageOptions` object. These are **different options** than in `QuestionOptions`. The list of available options can be found [here](ref/options/PageOptions.qmd).

```{python}
intro = vls.page("metrics", gender)

self_esteem = vls.page("RSSI", RSSI)
```

## Survey

When all elements are created, we can combine them into the final survey. We can do this with `survey()` function. It does two things -- returns a `Survey` object and builds a website with your survey.

```{python}
vls.survey(label, pages, title, description, options, create)
```

```{python}
vls.survey("My smart research", intro, self_esteem, title="Self-esteem and gender")
```

Building a website for the first time might take a few minutes due to `yarn` downloading or updating JavaScript dependencies. When the dependencies have been downloaded, the whole process gets much faster. The structure of the generated files and what to do with them is explained in Hosting section [below](#sec-hosting).

# Hosting {#sec-hosting}

The main way to host Veles surveys is through [VelesWeb](https://www.velesweb.org/). Currently in closed alpha. Self-hosting is also possible.

## VelesWeb

When you generate a Survey, you get a folder with a series of files. Their structure is not that important if you intent to use [VelesWeb](https://www.velesweb.org/). The only file that will be interesting, is the archive with `.tar.gz` extension.

Log in to your VelesWeb account, create a new survey, give it a title and -- optionally -- a description. Then choose the `.tar.gz` file from your hard drive. Submit and wait. It might take a minute or two. After that you'll see your survey's overview.

![](figs/getting_started/velesweb_overview.png)

From here you can test the survey, make it offline or turn on the real data collection. Each survey has two databases -- the main one and the test one. The test mode is the default. As you can see below, responses from both modes are separated.
