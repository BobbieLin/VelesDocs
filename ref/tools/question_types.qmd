title: "Question types"
subtitle: "Wrappers and available types of questions"
description: "Veles includes a series of different question types. Each of them can be passed as the `type` argument in [`question()`](./question.qmd) (or directly in [`Question()`](/ref/structure/Question.qmd). Every question type also has a wrapper that allows to create a [Question](/ref/structure/Question.qmd) object quicker. For example you can create a radio question with `question(question_type=\"radio\")` or with `radio()`."
