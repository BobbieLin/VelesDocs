Veles is a free and open source Python research package, primarly for social scientists. It's goal is to provide an interface for surveys and chronometric experiments. It combines the power of Survey.js and PsychoJS (PsychoPy) with a Python interface to create self contained research units. They can then be self-hosted or hosted using VelesWeb free service for academics.

# Overview

Veles is in alpha phase of development, but the goal features are:

-   Free and open source.

-   Text-based, so automatable and easily modifiable.

-   Questionnaire library for fast creation.

-   Integration with GitHub.

-   Ability to use JavaScript and CSS directly.

-   Open source documentation.

-   Python-based, so every Python tool works.

-   Easy to collaborate through git.

-   Custom redirection in the end (for panels).

-   PsychoPy integration.

-   Modifiable themes.

# Usage

See [Getting started](getting-started.qmd) for an introduction.

You can install development version with:
``` bash
pip install velesresearch@git+https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/VelesResearch.git
```

Veles is also on PyPI but it can't currently be considered stable anyway:
``` bash
pip install velesresearch
```

Note that **`bun` is required** for Veles to work. Use one of the following commands to install it:

```{bash}
# Linux and MacOS
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

If everything went well, command `bun --version` should return a version number. See [Getting started](getting-started.qmd) if you get any errors.
